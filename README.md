# Mask

## Project Info
This project is about is about comparing many different images. For this, I chose to compare between wearing a mask and not wearing a mask. You simply have to run the code and either wear a mask or not wear it. If you don't wear a mask for more than 5 seconds, the computer will recognize it and will play a screaming noise to alert you to wear a mask.

## How to execute
